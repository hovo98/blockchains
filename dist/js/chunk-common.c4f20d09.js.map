Dyson was born out of frustration with the current blockchain infrastructure. Most blockchain projects start with an ICO or IDO to raise money before any actual development. We decided to flip that script and show you our MVP first. Our goal is to build value in the DYS ecosystem to be shared among our community, validators, and developers.\r\n      p Sybil Singleton is an AI / human / nanobot hybrid sent from the future to speed the progression of blockchain development.
