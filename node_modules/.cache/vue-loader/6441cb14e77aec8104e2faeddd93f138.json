They were hard to build and could only handle a small number of transactions per second. Cosmos solves some of the hardest blockchain problems of scalability, usability and interoperability.\n      p The Cosmos SDK is a developer-friendly, modular framework, each powered by a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus algorithm such as Tendermint BFT, allowing developers to fully customize their decentralized applications and focus on business logic.\n      p At Cosmos, we’re building the \"Internet of Blockchains.\" Join our growing network and plug into the most powerful blockchain ecosystem.\n\n    tm-box.tm-box--outline.about-intro__links\n      div(slot=\"title\") New to Cosmos?\n      div(slot=\"menu-links\")\n        router-link(:to=\"{ name: 'intro' }\") Start Here\n        a(href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOcUfZPi6Iw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\") Rearchitecting the Blockchain Ecosystem\n        a(href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LApEkXJR_0M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\") Cosmos Architecture\n        a(href=\"https://blog.cosmos.network/understanding-the-value-proposition-of-cosmos-ecaef63350d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\") The Value Proposition of Cosmos\n        a(href=\"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/03/26/consensus-systems-with-ethan-buchman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\") History of BFT\n        a(href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxZ04w2x4nk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\") Consensus via BPOS\n        a(href=\"https://cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\") Cosmos Whitepaper\n        a(href=\"https://courses.blockgeeks.com/course/cos101-intro-cosmos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\") Blockgeeks Cosmos 101 Course\n\n  section-who\n\n  tm-section\n    div(slot=\"title\") Cosmos: A Brief History\n    .tm-timeline\n      .tm-timeline__year\n        .tm-timeline__year-label.h3 2014\n        ol\n          li Jae Kwon was the first person who #[a(href=\"https://cdn.relayto.com/media/files/LPgoWO18TCeMIggJVakt_tendermint.pdf\") applied Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) research in a \"Proof of Stake\" (PoS) public blockchain context], and went on to found Tendermint Inc (All in Bits Inc)\n          li Tendermint BFT is the most advanced implementation of BFT consensus algorithm and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) crypto economics to date.
