This wordmark should be used in almost all cases. It is preferred that the wordmark is paired with the brandmark, but if space is limited than the wordmark by itself is sufficient.\r\n        p The wordmark is constructed from the Gotham HTF Medium typeface. It has been kerned to improve the readability of a fully capitalized wordmark.
