        <mj-text>A new proposal by B-Harvest outlines improvements to the P2P management layer of the network targeted at achieving enhanced network stability. If passed and implemented, node operators would benefit from better connectivity between trusted peers and a stronger, more persistent connection to Tendermint.</mj-text>

        <mj-text mj-class="h3">Proportional slashing</mj-text>
        <mj-text>Centralization of consensus power within the Cosmos Hub has been a hot topic since the mainnet launch. A recent proposal by Sunny Aggarwal, dubbed proportional slashing, offers a solution to reduce the concentration of stake and voting power among the top validators occupying 67% control of the network. In this new proposal, the percentage a validator gets slashed for a fault is proportional to the validator‚Äôs percent of consensus power. This way, larger validators face harsher slash amounts thus incentivizing risk-managing delegators to delegate to smaller validators. In the current system, the slashing percent is equal for all slashes.</mj-text>

        <mj-text>Rust CosmWasm will bring the WebAssembly (Wasm) virtual machine (VM) to the Cosmos SDK for Rust developers. WebAssembly potentially enables software written in arbitrary languages to run securely on any hardware. Wasm is an intermediate language that compiles the developer‚Äôs programming language of choice to the user‚Äôs hardware.</mj-text>
